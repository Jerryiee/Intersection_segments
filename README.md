# Intersection_segments

This code uses OpenCV to display lines and input them via mouse clicks. It calculates the intersection point of the two lines and displays it on the image.

The 'intersection' function takes two lines as input and calculates the intersection point, if any, by using mathematical formula and returns it as (xi, yi) coordinates, otherwise returns None.
